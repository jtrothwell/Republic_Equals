# Republic_Equals
Replication code, list of sources, and meta-data for analysis used in my book Republic of Equals: A Manifesto for a Just Society (Princeton University Press 2019)

My goal is to allow others to replicate any original data point in the book; I have aimed to provide the code to facilitate that
with minor exceptions--some sources are not publicly available without a contract (eg Gallup data) and some of the analyses are very basic.
In any case, if you have questions, criticisms, or want to know how I did something that is not published here:
email me at jonathan_rothwell@gallup.com

Most important files are these:
See this file for description of all the files: "Manifest_External_Documentation.csv"
See this file for list of sources and variable descriptions: "Appendix_Data_Dictionary_&_Sourcing.xlsx"
